						   Note to CSH: I don't really update this much anymore, so this might be 
						   outdated. :) About this page, this was a final project I've worked on for
						   two classes. I double majored in hs for media communications (explains the
						   artsy stuff and the portfolio and in computer science). I don't do graphics
						   much anymore unless requested by someone I know.
